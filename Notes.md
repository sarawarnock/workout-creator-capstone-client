<p>What is an EMOM? 
<br /><br />
EMOM stands for 'Every Minute On the Minute' - a burst style of workout 
where you perform an exercise starting at the top of each minute and resting until the next minute. 
Complete the amount of reps within the minute as fast as possible.

<br /><br />
This style is a type of MetCon. MetCon is short for metabolic conditioning; a term that 
incorporates short bouts of higher-intensity training designed to increase metabolic demand 
and increase energy usage.</p>
